# About Our Project 
## AquaUnity: Collaborative Efforts for Clean Water and Sanitation Solutions
### Problem Statement:
The lack of access to clean water and sanitation continues to be a pressing global issue, particularly impacting vulnerable communities. Our proposed solution is to develop a unified online platform that connects volunteers, facilitates donations, and implements sustainable projects. 
### Objectives:
 * The platform will aggregate data on polluted lakes, rivers, and other water bodies, enabling users to pinpoint areas in urgent need of cleanup.
 * The platform should be able to display the volunteers who is near to the location of the polluted water resource.
   
### Sustainable Development Goal:6
#### Clean water and sanitization:
This goal directly addresses the need for universal access to safe and affordable drinking water and adequate sanitation for all. By ensuring access to clean water and sanitation facilities, SDG 6 aims to improve health outcomes, reduce water-related diseases, and enhance overall well-being.
