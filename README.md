## AquaUnity: Collaborative Efforts for Clean Water and Sanitation Solutions
### Problem Statement:
The lack of access to clean water and sanitation continues to be a pressing global issue, particularly impacting vulnerable communities. Our proposed solution is to develop a unified online platform that connects volunteers, facilitates donations, and implements sustainable projects. 
### Objectives:
 * The platform will aggregate data on polluted lakes, rivers, and other water bodies, enabling users to pinpoint areas in urgent need of cleanup.
 * The platform should be able to display the volunteers who is near to the location of the polluted water resource.
   
### Sustainable Development Goal:6
#### Clean water and sanitization:
This goal directly addresses the need for universal access to safe and affordable drinking water and adequate sanitation for all. By ensuring access to clean water and sanitation facilities, SDG 6 aims to improve health outcomes, reduce water-related diseases, and enhance overall well-being.
#### Target : 6.3 
By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing
recycling and safe reuse globally.
####  Performance Indicator(PI) : 6.3.2 
Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality.
###  Issues:
#### 1) Social
* Improved Public Health: Access to clean water is essential for drinking, sanitation, and hygiene practices, reducing the incidence of water-related illnesses and improving overall well-being.
#### 2) Economic
* Public Health Savings: Healthy populations are more productive and require fewer medical interventions, resulting in long-term savings for healthcare systems and individuals.
#### 3) Environment
* Biodiversity Conservation: Cleaner water environments support a diverse range of aquatic species, including fish, amphibians, and invertebrates.
* Improvement of Water Resources: Cleaner water resources resulting from cleanup activities benefit not only aquatic life but also provide essential resources for human communities.
###  Implementation
####  Implementation Platforms
A significant portion of the backend project involved working with Java code and the Spring Boot framework, executed using IntelliJ IDEA. The rest of the development, including the frontend and its integration with the backend, was done using Visual Studio Code. For the database, we used MySQL.
#### Programming Language
 The programming languages used in this project include:
  * React framework for frontend.
  * Java for backend.
  * Swagger for APIs testing.
