## AquaUnity: Collaborative Efforts for Clean Water and Sanitation Solutions
### Problem Statement:
##### The lack of access to clean water and sanitation continues to be a pressing global issue, particularly impacting vulnerable communities. Our proposed solution is to develop a unified online platform that connects volunteers, facilitates donations, and implements sustainable projects. 
### Objectives:
##### -The platform will aggregate data on polluted lakes, rivers, and other water bodies, enabling users to pinpoint areas in urgent need of cleanup.
##### -The platform should be able to display the volunteers who is near to the location of the polluted water resource.
